With over a decade of experience in IT—from hardware and support roles to software development and cloud system administration—I’ve built a deep, end-to-end understanding of how modern systems run. I enjoy solving complex problems, automating manual processes, and continuously improving the environments I work with. My technical toolkit includes Docker, Python, CI/CD, Ansible, Terraform, and Azure, and I’m actively growing my expertise in DevOps and data engineering. Currently working in the fintech sector at HedgeServ, I’m motivated by roles that allow me to build efficient, scalable, and automated solutions.



Professional Development & Hands-On Projects (Nov 2023 – Present)
Actively pursuing structured self-development to grow into DevOps, cloud engineering, and modern system administration. Involved in mentorship programs, tech communities, and project-based learning to strengthen practical skills across infrastructure, automation, and software delivery.
Key Focus Areas & Achievements:
    • Built and managed cloud environments on Azure and AWS to practice infrastructure provisioning, networking, compute, and storage.
    • Designed and maintained on-premise lab environments using VMware/Hyper-V/Proxmox, including Linux servers, VMs, and containerized application stacks.
    • Implemented monitoring and security tools such as Wazuh and Zabbix to gain experience in SIEM, observability, and hybrid environment monitoring.
    • Practiced automation and Infrastructure-as-Code using Ansible and Terraform, building reusable playbooks and deployment modules.
